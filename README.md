# Stonehenge - Pure CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/JjJKmor](https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/JjJKmor).

A 3D approximation of what the megalithic monument of Stonehenge looked like. There are many different interpretations of how it was, I have made mine based on several of them and adapting it to what I could do in CSS.
